//! plx_media: the media layer of the PlxNative application core.
//!
//! Demux (`ff`, the bundled FFmpeg), the HTTPS media plane (`curlio`), the strict HLS parser (`hls`),
//! the adaptive-bitrate controller (`abr`), the access-unit queues (`aq`), the buffer-feed engine
//! (`player`) and route selection (`route`). It is the `media` layer of `ci/module-layers.ini`: it
//! uses `base`, `machine`, `platform`, `gfx`, `net`, `plex`, `telemetry` and `data` and nothing
//! above them. Its seven members call each other in a cycle (`abr`, `curlio`, `ff`, `hls`, `player`
//! and `route`), which is why they are one crate.
//!
//! The Starfish/ACB surface is declared here and nowhere else: `sf_on_event` and `acb_on_event`
//! (`player`), which `src/starfish.c` calls, and the externs of `player::ffi`. The crate links nothing itself; the Makefile's final link resolves them.
//!
//! `test-support` exposes the `cfg(test)` seams the layers above test through (`player::preview`,
//! `player::restore_state_for_test`, ...). The application crate enables it in `[dev-dependencies]`
//! only, so no shipped build sees it.
