//! plx_data: the data layer of the PlxNative application core.
//!
//! The content stores and the data modules they own: `stores` (one command vocabulary and one
//! machine per data store), `pms` (the Home catalog), `browse` (the per-section library catalog),
//! `metadata` (the item detail), `person`, `collection`, `search` and `viewstate` (the view-state
//! writes). It is the `data` layer of `ci/module-layers.ini`: it uses `base`, `machine`,
//! `platform`, `net`, `plex` and `telemetry` and nothing above them, so it names no screen, widget
//! or application type.
//!
//! `test-support` exposes the seams the layers above drive their tests through
//! (`pms::seed_for_test`, `metadata::set_current_for_test`, `browse::view::*::fixture`, ...) and
//! switches the `cfg(not(test))` arms a dependent's tests need in their test form. The application
//! crate enables it in `[dev-dependencies]` only, so no shipped build sees it.
