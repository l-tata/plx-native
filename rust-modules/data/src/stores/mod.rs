//! **Stores as machines** (restructure spec §2.1/§2.2, phase 4; `docs/stores-as-machines.md`).
//!
//! Seven data modules provide the application's server-derived state — `browse`, `pms` (the Home
//! hubs), `metadata`, `search`, `person`, `collection`, `viewstate`. All seven are physically owned by one
//! [`Stores`] aggregate per `crate::app::bridge::Bridge`, each with its own per-instance state,
//! adapter and notice (Browse/Person/ViewState landed first; Search, Hubs and Metadata completed
//! the port). This layer puts ONE entrance in front of each: a [`StoreCmd`] is the complete,
//! enumerated vocabulary of mutations, a store's owned command decoder is the one place its
//! vocabulary is applied, and every command that changes observable state or landing that changes
//! the store raises the store's NOTICE (a generation the bridge dispatcher delivers to every live
//! instance as `ScreenEvent::StoreChanged`, spec §3.4).
//!
//! Owned stores have two caller shapes and one explicit owner: screens emit `AppFx::Store(id, cmd)` for
//! `app/bridge.rs` to deliver, while same-turn application boundaries call a method on the
//! [`Stores`] value they already hold. There is no generic `apply(cmd)` dispatcher any more — every
//! store's vocabulary is applied only through its own owner.
//!
//! What lives here is the vocabulary and machines plus all seven stores' production aggregate; no
//! data stays in a legacy compatibility global any more (§14 complete). This module names data
//! crates, `plx_machine::machine` and — since
//! phase 11's landing schedule — `plx_machine::landgate`, and nothing else (spec §2.1's layer rule;
//! `ci/check-deps.sh`'s `mutators` gate refuses the old spelling outside `stores/` and the data
//! modules).

use plx_machine::machine::StoreOrd;

// The advisory endpoint-refresh request, its first-observation-ordered set, and the host trait that
// turns one into an effect live in `plex::retry`: the plaintext grant's upgrade retry (`plex`) answers
// with the same set the data layer's outcomes carry, and `plex` cannot name this module. Re-exported
// so every store, adapter and screen keeps its spelling; `StoreEffectHost` is the name the stores'
// machines are written against.
